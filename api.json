      "full": "The Grey Lady is a widespread archetype of ghost appearing throughout European and American folklore, characterized by a female apparition dressed in grey or silver garments. These spectral figures are among the most commonly reported ghostly manifestations, appearing in castles, manor houses, theaters, and historic buildings across the world. Unlike the more ominous Black Shuck or White Lady variants, Grey Ladies typically appear melancholic rather than threatening, often associated with tragic love stories or unfulfilled duties."
